TODO :

INTERVAL shld be zero for 1 min time_frame

Entry Criteria :

1. Trade according to Supertrend
2. When EMA9 crosses EMA21
3. Any parts(OHLC) of current candle touches EMA9.  
If previous signal showing Entry but no position made due to above criteria then we have check the same in current candle and all other criteria to take a position.
4. Difference between current price and nearby EMA(50/200) not less than Target Price for stock only. Not for Crudeoil.(10pts min)


Watch now implement later :

1. Sometimes EMA9 already crosses in previous candles but Supertrend signal coming in current candle. In those cases we need to skip Entry Criteria 3.
2. When target achived but EMA21 crosses EMA51 then we need to continue with current trade and  look for bigger target.

Exit Criteria :

1. If currenct price => Target price

2. If EMA9 < EMA21

3. if Supertrend showing reverse signal

4. If last candle is inverted hammer

5. If current price - EMA9 > 10

6. 20 points scalping



Challenges :

1. Too many trading 

2. Data limitations and have to incorporate multiple data sources

FYERS : what is the daily request limit for historical data via truedata api from Fyers 
3rd part app? Hi Sir, Apologies for the late reply. One can make max 3 request in 1 sec, 
100 request in 1 min and max 6000 in 1 hour as per Truedata doc link90.

YAHOO : JSON output doesn't work for Yahoo-like style. We have API limits 100 000 requests per day.
